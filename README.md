My take(s) at the RPG Combat kata

## Log

### [2024-03-01](./2024-03-01-clj/README.md) (Clojure)

Trying the Magical items variation of the kata.

- First iteration with Clojure.
- Test-Driven Development.
- Focus on decoupling and learning Clojure features (Records, protocols, etc.)

### [2023-09-10](./2023-09-10-ts/README.md) (TypeScript)

Trying out the Magical Objects variant of the kata with TypeScript.

- Test-Driven Development.
- Focus on practicing SOLID principles.

### [2023-09-09](./2023-09-09-ts/README.md) (TypeScript)

A solution in TypeScript. This was live coded during a 2-hour streaming on Twitch.

- Test-Driven Development.
- Focus on decoupling and cohesion.

### [2023-01-22](./2023-01-22-rust/README.md) (Rust)

A solution in Rust.

- Fight against the borrow checker for the `heal` method ⚔️
- Use of **traits** to make the character able to interact with both other characters and with props.
- Very basic error handling
